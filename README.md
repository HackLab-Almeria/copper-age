# copper-age

Copper age aims to be an [Maintest game](http://wiki.minetest.net/Subgames/Minetest_Game) for implementing Chalcolithic recreations, with items, material, mobs and recipes as realistic as possible.

Copper-age has been created when participating in the [JamToday Almer√≠a 2017](http://www.jamtodayalmeria.com/) [game jam](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_jam).

We are open to collaborations and enhancements, but please document each feature with bibliographic reference to be as accurate as possible.
